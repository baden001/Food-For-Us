Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and melt a bit of butter.

Customizable: Adjust the components based on your preferences.
Ingredients
4 large eggs
4 slices of bacon (or sausage patties, if preferred)
2 medium potatoes (for hash browns), grated
2 tbsp olive oil or butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tbsp granulated sugar
1 cup milk
1 large egg (for pancakes)
1 tsp vanilla extract
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp butter (for pancakes)
Maple syrup (for serving)
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh fruit (optional, for garnish)
The Method
1. Cook the Bacon (or Sausage)
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove the bacon from the skillet and place it on paper towels to drain excess fat. For sausage patties, cook them in the same skillet, turning them occasionally, until browned and cooked through. Set aside.

2. Make the Hash Browns
Peel and grate the potatoes using a box grater. Place the grated potatoes in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.

In the same skillet you used for bacon, heat 1-2 tbsp of olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the grated potatoes in a thin layer, pressing them down with a spatula. Cook for 4-5 minutes per side, until crispy and golden brown. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. Scramble the Eggs
In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and melt a small amount of butter or oil. Pour in the eggs and stir gently, cooking until soft curds form. Remove from the heat while still slightly runny, as they will continue cooking from the residual heat.

4. Make the Pancakes
In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring just until combined—don’t overmix, as that can make the pancakes tough.

Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and melt a bit of butter. Pour small amounts of batter onto the skillet, cooking the pancakes for about 2-3 minutes per side or until golden brown. Keep warm by covering them with a towel.

5. Assemble and Serve
To serve, place the scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, hash browns, and pancakes on a plate. Drizzle the pancakes with maple syrup and garnish with fresh fruit, if desired.

Tips for the Perfect American Breakfast
Crispy Bacon: For the crispiest bacon, cook it slowly over medium heat rather than high heat.
Fluffy Pancakes: Don’t overmix your pancake batter—lumps are okay!
Customize Your Breakfast: Add sautéed veggies to the hash browns or throw in some cheese to the scrambled eggs for extra flavor.
Why I Love This Recipe
An American breakfast has always been a source of nostalgia for me. It’s the meal that feels like home, especially when shared with loved ones. Growing up, we’d often have big family breakfasts on Sundays, where everyone would gather around the table, and we’d dig into plates piled high with eggs, bacon, and pancakes. It’s a meal that brings comfort and energy—perfect for fueling up for whatever the day has in store.
